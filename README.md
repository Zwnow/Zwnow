# Hi, Iâ€™m Sven!

I am a software engineer apprentice from Germany. I started coding in 2021 and have been very busy learning new things since!
In my time off I occasionally draw, tattoo or play some videogames with my friends. Usually I spend my time learning new coding stuff though!

During my **apprenticeship** I have learned the following development skills:

| Tech | Description |
|------|-------------|
| C/AL | Is the language that is used within the C/SIDE IDE that is used by Microsoft Dynamics NAV. I worked with NAV 18.|
| C# | We used C# for our projects in tech-school. I worked on learning C# in my time off too. |
| SQL | We used SQL-Server for our school projects. |

Additionally I have peeked into the following technologies in my time off:

| Tech | Description |
|------|-------------|
| HTML | With HTTP stuff so I was able to get into web development. Originally learned while doing The Odin Project. |
| CSS | Goes hand in hand with the above. |
| Javascript | To be able to give websites more interactivity. |
| React | The library I created my personal homepage with. |

**Currently learning:**
- More React functionality
- Lua & Neovim
- Rust

## My goals:
I want to become a skilled software developer and invest a lot of time to reach this goal. Ultimately I want to make a living off of my passion and my craft and want to look back at my work with pride.
